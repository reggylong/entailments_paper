% What do I want to say
% We want to do question answering 
% Large scale question answering is hard
% It is hard because many ways to ask same question
% Impractical to train system on every way to ask same question
% Also system may need to perform inference
% For example 
% Can learn inference rules from entailment graphs
% Problem is to build these graphs


% What do I want to say
% Entailment graphs useful way to represent inference rules
% Ex: building robust question answering systems
% Ex: Mismatch between utterance and knowledge base
% In order to get wide coverage, need a lot of data
% In order to use for large scale qa, need a good global entailment graph

Entailment graphs are a compact method of representing 
a set of inference rules for relationships between
entities. Learning such a graph
