\section{Experiments}

Our experiments target the following questions
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is it computationally feasible to extract relations from 
  such a large corpus?
\item How does our system compare to the state of the art (e.g. \reverb).
\item Does coreference resolution improve the number of 
  ``usable'' relation triples?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Dataset}
We use the \newsspike{} dataset collected in \citet{zhang2013parallelparaphrase}.
This dataset is a collection of news article texts, all taken from the months of
Janurary and February in 2013, and contains 546,713 such texts. On average,
each news article contains between 31 and 32 sentences.
