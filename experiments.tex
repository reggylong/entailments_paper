\section{Experiments}

Our experiments aim to identify quantative and qualitative differences
between the ReVerb and Stanford OpenIE systems. Another important question
is whether using coreference resolution generates more relation triples. 
Ultimately, we would like to compare the entailment graphs generated from
each system's extracted relation triples. 

\subsection{Dataset}
We use the \newsspike{} dataset collected in \citet{zhang2013parallelparaphrase}.
This dataset is a collection of news article texts, all taken from the months of
Janurary and February in 2013, and contains 546,713 such texts. On average,
each news article contains between 31 and 32 sentences.
